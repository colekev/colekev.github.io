title: Updated 2016 Quarterback &#58 Receiver Values
---

This is an update to my [previous post](https://colekev.github.io/opportunity-scores-rookie-wr-2016/) on finding over/undervalued receivers based on the realtionship between signal-callers and their receivers.

Last offseason, we used this relationship to identify that the Coltsâ€™ receivers were vastly overvalued based on the [Andrew Luck halo effect](http://rotoviz.com/2015/04/andrew-luck-fantasy-halo-effect/), that you [should likely pass](http://rotoviz.com/2015/04/trestman-effect-joe-flacco-actually-undervalued/) on Joe Flacco, and that Blake Bortles [had breakout potential](http://rotoviz.com/2015/04/four-quarterbackreceiver-adp-arbitrage-opportunities/) with such a strong receiving corps.

For more background on the analysis, you can see my post from earlier this offseason on [five undervalued quarterbacks](http://rotoviz.com/2016/05/undervalued-quarterbacks-fantasy-2016/?hvid=2JrtbF) using this relationship. 

That was three months ago, and ADPs have changed greatly based upon new and shifts in drafters' perceptions. Here are the updated chart showing the relationship between quarterback and receiver ADPs using the [RotoViz Best Ball ADP App](http://rotoviz.com/best-ball-adp/). For more information on exactly how these values are calculated, see

This graph can be a little difficult to assess, but there are clear certain teams where the relationship between quarterback and receivers ADPs vary from the norm. 

An easier way to digest the information is a bar chart showing the exact distance from the regression line for every team.

If you're a late-round quarterback enthusiast, you have a few great choices this year. Robert Griffin III is surrounded by receiving talent (at least in the minds of fantasy footballers), yet is the 28th quarterback of the board in recent MFL10s. When you add in Griffin's rushing ability, he could be a steal in this year's drafts.

Matthews Stafford and Jay Cutler don't stir confidence in the hearts of many, but both have mutiple receiving weapons at farily high ADPs this season. Stafford lost Calvin Johnson, but the prospects for Golden Tate and Marvin Jones to replace that production are viewed as favorable. Jay Culter could have a healthy Alshon Jeffery in 2016, plus the addition of 2015 top-10 pick Kevin White to the receiving corps. Stafford and Cutler aren't without risks, but their respective ADPs make them huge bargains in comparison to their highly valued receivers.

You can find my [R code](https://github.com/colekev/Opportunity-Scores-for-Rookie-WRs/blob/master/OS_2016.R) for calculating these scores at my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/colekev/Opportunity-Scores-for-Rookie-WRs).
