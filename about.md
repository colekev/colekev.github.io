I'm an investment professional with 10-plus years experience as an equity and credit analyst a boutique money manager and major credit rating agency. I'm also a graduate of the selective [Metis data science bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps), which furthered my knowledge of Python, SQL, D3, NLP and other programming tools. Currently, I'm working at a freelance data analyst.

As a diehard football fan, I've used my programming skills to write data-driven analyses published in [Pro Football Focus](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/author/colekev/), [RotoViz](http://rotoviz.com/author/colekev/) and [numberFire](https://www.numberfire.com/author/kevin-cole). In the 2016 offseason, I wrote two articles for Rotoworld on the results of my logistic regression model for forecasting the NFL success of [running back](http://www.rotoworld.com/articles/nfl/62595/446/forecasting-rb-performance) and [wide receiver](http://www.rotoworld.com/articles/nfl/62596/446/forecasting-wr-performance) prospects.
