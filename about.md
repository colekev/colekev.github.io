I'm current enrolled in the [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/) data science bootcamp, furthering my knowledge of Python, SQL, D3 and other tools.

I'm also a diehard football fan, and have written data-driven analyses for [Pro Football Focus](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/author/colekev/), [RotoViz](http://rotoviz.com/author/colekev/) and [numberFire](https://www.numberfire.com/author/kevin-cole).

In the 2016 offseason, I wrote two articles for Rotoworld on the results of my logistic regression model for forecasting the NFL success of [running back](http://www.rotoworld.com/articles/nfl/62595/446/forecasting-rb-performance) and [wide receiver](http://www.rotoworld.com/articles/nfl/62596/446/forecasting-wr-performance) prospects.
