I worked for roughly 15 years as an equity and credit analyst for boutique investment firms and major debt rating agencies. A couple years ago I became more interested in data science, and taught myself R, a [statistical computing programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)). As a diehard football fan, I've used my programming skills to write data-driven analyses published in [Pro Football Focus](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/author/colekev/), [RotoViz](http://rotoviz.com/author/colekev/) and [numberFire](https://www.numberfire.com/author/kevin-cole).

In the 2016 offseason, I wrote two articles for Rotoworld on the results of my logistic regression model for forecasting the NFL success of [running back](http://www.rotoworld.com/articles/nfl/62595/446/forecasting-rb-performance) and [wide receiver](http://www.rotoworld.com/articles/nfl/62596/446/forecasting-wr-performance) prospects.

I'm currently enrolled in the selective [Metis data science bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps), furthering my knowledge of Python, SQL, D3, NLP and other programming tools. Upon graduation, I hope to marry my programming skills and finance background by finding a position in the growing field of financial technology.
